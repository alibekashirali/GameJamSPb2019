## Gameplay descriptions
Control is carried out by arrows, F - start dialog with NPC or shout, if no one is around.
You should track 2 scales: your own time and "karma", time runs - you hurry, but on the way you meet people, you can help them, and you can pass by and save time, when you help - your karma increases, but you lose more time.
We think people must have skill time managment and remain people, not be indifferent.
