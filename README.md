# GameJamSPb2019
Our team shortly named as "nooBleen" (Bleen nooBleen = new Bleen("Noo");) created a game when we took part in 'Game Jam SPb 2019' and had only 24 hours for work.

## Gameplay descriptions
Control is carried out by arrows. Shift helps you if you stuck. Press F (c) to start dialog with NPC or shout, if no one is around.
You should track 2 scales: your own time and "humaneness". On the way you meet people, you can talk to them and even help them and increase your humaneness, but you lose time on it and can be late on work.
We think people must have skill to manage their own time and to remain people, not to be indifferent.
